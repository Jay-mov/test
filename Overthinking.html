          <p>Ask yourself as to why I would wanna waste something good i have with you for soneone else that i wont love. I wouldn't be that foolish to back stab you like that. All the hours that i spent not talking to you or not replying to your messages, i've spent it either playing video games or watching youtube or I prolly didnt even hear my phone ring cuz of the music. I'm sorry that i dont respond to you quickly. I love you </p>
